To build the software in this "moos-ivp" repository, first
build the MOOS software:

> ./build-moos.sh

You should only ever have to do this once upon an initial checkout
from the SVN repository. 

Thereafter the ivp tree can be build by:

> cd ivp/src
> cmake ./
> make

See the README file in moos-ivp/ivp/src for more specific
build info regarding that tree.
