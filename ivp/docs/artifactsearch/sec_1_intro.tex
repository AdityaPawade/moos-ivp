\section{Introduction}
\label{intro}

The helm module is a group of C++ libraries and a single executable
(phelm) that uses multi-objective behavior-based control to produce
actuator commands for controlling an autonomous platform. The
behavior-based control principles described here apply generally, but
the perspective here is of a particular implementation in a
MOOS-enabled vehicle or robot. In practice, helm is a single
process running in a (MOOS) community of processes on a single CPU of
a robotic platform, as in Figure \ref{conceptone}.

MOOS is an acronym for Mission Oriented Operating Suite, and is an
umbrella term for a set of libraries and applications designed to
facilitate research in the mobile robotic domain \cite{new03}. Some
familiarity with MOOS is assumed here.
