pArtifactMapper implements MOOSApp functionality for the XYArtifactGrid C++ class.

\subsection{XYArtifactGrid}
\label{XYArtifactGrid}

XYArtifactGrid is a simple class derived from XYGrid.  Using the functionality of XYGrid, this class is able to instantiate a search grid on top of a given search area.  Each cell in this search grid has a value member and a utility member.  The value member can be set to any double.  The utility member is bounded by the minimum and maximum utilities set by the programmer.

The simple class diagram for pArtifactMapper is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:artifactmapper}.

The pAntler configuration block for pArtifactMapper looks like this:
\begin{verbatim}
//------------------------------------------
// pArtifactMapper config block
ProcessConfig = pArtifactMapper
{
   AppTick   = 4
   CommsTick = 4
   
   GridPoly =  poly:label,A:-60,-40:50,10:80,-40:-40,-80
   GridSize = 5.0
   GridInit = .5
}
\end{verbatim}

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf GridPoly}  A valid polygon initialization string (must be convex) that covers the search area.
\item {\bf GridSize}  The width/height of each cell in the search grid in meters.
\item {\bf GridInit}  The initializing value for each cell.
\end{itemize}
