Mission 1: (alpha.moos,  mission1.bhv)
  Simple waypoint mission with a return-home waypoint triggered 
  after a box-run.
    
Mission 2: (alpha.moos,  mission2.bhv)
  Simple waypoint mission. Box run repeats itself. The user will set 
  RETURN true to trigger the return-home behavior and interupt 
  the first waypoint behavior.
  
Mission 3: (alpha.moos,  mission3.bhv)
  Test the OpRegion. A waypoint behavior takes the vehicle outside 
  the OpRegion polygon and the helm posts all-stop.

Mission X: (missionX.moos, missionX.bhv)
   Waypoint mission w/ dynamic waypoint re-tasking. 
   iRemote is configured to write to the WAYPOINT_UPDATES variable. 
   Can also test for faulty waypoint updates.

Mission Y: (missionY.moos, missionY.bhv)
   Loiter mission w/ dynamic loiter region re-tasking. 
   iRemote is configured to write to the NEW_LOITER variable. 
   Can also test for faulty loiter polygon updates.

Mission Z: (missionZ.moos, missionZ.bhv)
   Loiter mission w/ ConstantDepth behavior
   To test ConstantDepth, iMarineSim with depth, pMarineViewer depth
   display and pTransponderAIS functionality.
