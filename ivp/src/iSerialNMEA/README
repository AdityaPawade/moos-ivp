> usage: (must be root or have permissions to open the serial port)
iSerialNMEA file.moos [name to register with moos]

an example .moos configuration file (with comments) is provided
in this directory.

this process may also be launched by pAntler.

> purpose: 
takes NMEA data streaming into the serial port specified in 
the configuration block of the .moos file and attempts to parse
out position, heading, speed information to publish as AIS_REPORT

this process was written primarily as a special purpose script
to parse serial data from the R/V point sur during the PN'07
exercises. With modification, it may be useful for other serial
NMEA streams.
