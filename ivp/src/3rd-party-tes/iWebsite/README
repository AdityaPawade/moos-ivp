readme for iWebsite:

this process is a program running under the MOOS robotic control
software system developed by paul newman:
http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/%7Epnewman/TheMOOS/index.html

> compilation: type in the iWebsite directory

make

> usage:
iWebsite file.moos [name to register with moos]

an example .moos configuration file (with comments) is provided
in this directory.

this process may also be launched by pAntler.

> purpose:
the process serves as an interface between a webserver containing a text file
of values to be parsed into the moosdb that iWebsite is associated with.

the program uses the linux process "wget" (which must be available) to
procure a text file from a given server and cached in a given local folder.
the text file is then parsed and values are echoed into the db based on the
configuration values. the program (by default) will not update the moosdb
unless a new sequence number (which may be a timestamp) is incremented in the 
remote file. please read the notes in the example iWebsite.moos file and the included
iWebsite.mission file (assumed to reside remotely).
