readme for pVirtualTether:

this process is a program running under the MOOS robotic control
software system developed by paul newman:
http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/%7Epnewman/TheMOOS/index.html

> compilation (in directory or moos-ivp/ivp/src/):
make

> usage:
pVirtualTether file.moos [name to register with moos]

an example .moos configuration file (with comments) is provided
in this directory.

this process may also be launched by pAntler.

> purpose:
this program acts as a "safety net" for the Helm when operating around a 
moving vehicle (such as a ship). it requires an "AIS_REPORT" string of the format
used by pTransponderAIS from the ship (called the 'contact' in the .moos block). 
it uses the position of the contact as the center of the allowed region. if the
vehicle roams beyond the allowed region or it does not receive AIS_REPORTS from the
contact after a specified amount of time ('timeout' in .moos block) it sets
the MOOS variable "MOOS_MANUAL_OVERRIDE" to true, effectively shutting off the helm.
if contact is reestablished, MOOS_MANUAL_OVERRIDE is reset to false, turning back on the helm.

if distance causes the MOOS_MANUAL_OVERRIDE trigger, it will not untrigger unless it receives
a TETHER_OVERRIDE = true, at which point the tether distance is increased to the current
distance to the vehicle plus 20%.
