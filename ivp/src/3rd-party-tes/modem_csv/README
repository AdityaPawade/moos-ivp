this is a special purpose script. it takes a directory containing *.alog files, recursively searches
through processing all alog files. It converts the MOOS variable MICROMODEM_RAW (messages to the modem from elsewhere)
and MICROMODEM_TO_MODEM (messages to the modem from the vehicle) into *.CSV files in the format used
by ModemTool (WHOI). *.CSV files are put in the current working directory.

compile: make
(binary is put in MOOS-IvP bin directory)
usage: modem_csv directory_with_alog_files modem_id [time offset]

example (for unicorn): modem_csv ~/project-plus07-data/Unicorn/ 3 0
