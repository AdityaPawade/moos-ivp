readme for CTDLogger:

this process is a program running under the MOOS robotic control
software system developed by paul newman:
http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/%7Epnewman/TheMOOS/index.html

> compilation: type in the iWebsite directory

make

> usage:
CTDLogger file.moos [name to register with moos]

an example .moos configuration file (with comments) is provided
in this directory.

this process may also be launched by pAntler.
the only *.moos file value is:
LogPath	some_path

which specifies the path to log to (current user must have write).
otherwise it logs to the current working directory.

> purpose:
writes out a log file with CTD data for the kayak CTD (SBE49)

it begins logging when the moos variable CTD_LOG is set to true
and stops the file when CTD_LOG is set to false.

pSamplingControl is used to control the logging behavior of this
process.

CTDLogger requires the moos variables:

CTD_TCPSV (ctd data)
GPS_LATITUDE
GPS_LONGITUDE
CTD_LOG (true or false)
SENSOR_MISSION (1,2, 3, or 4 -to log the mission number)
