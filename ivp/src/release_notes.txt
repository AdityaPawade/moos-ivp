o uFunctionVis 
  Fixed glitch that preveneted the Behaviors pull-down menu from appearing 
  upon startup

o pMarineViewer
  - Fixed problem where MVIEWER_LCLICK was not being published correctly
  - Added ability to "clear" geometric objects with PMV_CLEAR subscription
  - Fixed problem in pMarineViewer where the background image defaulted to
    the MIT campus if left unspecified, and wouldn't draw at all if the 
    MIT image was removed from ivp/data/. It now launches and draws fine if
    no background image is found or if left unspecified.
  
o uFldNodeBroker
  - Fixed a bug that could prevent node connections in some cases.

o pDeadManPost (New App)

o lib_geometry
  - Added bearingMinMaxToPoly utility
  - Added ConvexHullGenerator, accepts a series of points, returns a
    convex hull in the form of an XYPolygon

o BHV_AvoidObstacles
 
o New application: pObstacleMgr

o New application: iDiffThrust

o uSimMarine
  - Added support for differential thrust mode
  - Bug fix - negative thrust was not working properly
  - Added support for halting the vehicle propagation when OBSTACLE_HIT=1 is
  posted.

o pNodeReport
  - Added ability to detect when in reverse thrust mode and note it in the
  NODE_REPORT

o pHelmIvP 
  - Upon unfound behavior, posts MALCONFIG and remains up vs. quitting

o BHV_OpRegion
  - Added optional opregion_poly_var config parameter that names a MOOS
  variable that will be posted containing the prevailing OpRegion polygon
  upon startup
  - Fixed posting of VIEW_POLYGON representing the OpRegion poly, to now
  have a disctinct label, so successive postings will result in a redraw
  of the polygon. A re-posting may happen if the OpRegion poly is updated
  through the updates variable.

o BHV_Waypoint
  - supporting config parameter currix=N which allows the behavior to immediately
  regard the current waypoint index to be set to N. Normally upon startup, or upon
  an update to the waypoints, the index is set to zero, the first waypoint. This
  parameter allows for an override of that policy.

  - An optional MOOS variable may be named via the wpt_dist_to_next parameter
  which, if non-empty, results in the posting to this variable of the linear
  distance to the next waypoint from the vehicle's current position. 
  This allows other MOOS apps or behaviors to possibly modify their function, e.g.,
  either changing speed or toggling a sensor as a turn is approached.
  This values changes to -1 in the idle state.

  - An optional MOOS variable may be named via the wpt_dist_to_prev parameter
  which, if non-empty, results in the posting to this variable of the linear
  distance to the previous waypoint from the vehicle's current position. 
  This allows other MOOS apps or behaviors to possibly modify their function, e.g.,
  either changing speed or toggling a sensor after a waypoint has been achieved.
  This values changes to -1 in the idle state.

  - The wptflag parameter has been augmented to allow for macros $(NX), $(NY), 
  $[NX], and $[NY] to be expanded to the x-y components of the next waypoint.

  - An optional config parameter, crs_spd_zaic_ratio=N, where N is in the 
 range of [1,99]. This sets the weight of the heading portion of the heading-spd
 zaic created in the ZAIC (default) mode for IvP function creation. The corresponding
 speed weight is implied to be 100-N, so the two always add to 100 and neither is
 below 1 or greater than 99. The default is 50-50.

o lib_geometry 
  - Added bearingMinMaxToPoly in GeomUtils.cpp
  - Added ability to delete a vertex by index number in XYSegList
    void XYSegList::delete_vertex(unsigned int);
  - Added a check for a turn left given three points in AngleUtils.cpp
    bool threePointTurnLeft(double, ..., double);
  - Added the ConvexHullGenerator class for determining a convex hull in 
    the form of an XYPolyon, given a set of points in the x-y plane

o aloggrep
  - Added --no_comments (or -nc) command line arg to allow for the output 
    to discard the comments typically found at the top of an alog file
  - Added --no_report (or -nr) command line arg to allow for the output 
    to not produce the summary report normally generate to stdout during
    normal operation.
  - Added the --quiet (or -q) command which is essentially a shortcut for 
    --no_comments and --no_report

o uSimMarine
  - Supports reverse thrust (DESIRED_THRUST < 0)
  - Supports differential thrust mode
  - Essentially allows the vehicle to traverse backwards using normal waypoint
    behaviors
