Version 3.0.3
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- In the IvPBuild Toolbox - Changed the interface to the AOF class to
simplify user coding and documentation. The current recommended
interface is with the AOF::evalPoint() function, but the older
AOF::evalBox() function is still supported.

- The CMakeLists.txt file for iRemote is included in this release. It
was inadvertently ommitted in the prior release.

-An updated version of pLogger (from the Oxford tree) is in this
release. The version included in the previous release did not generate
slog files.

- Fixed a bug in the IvPBuild Toolbox (lib_ivpbuild) in the use of the
directed-refine algorithm with the RT_Focus class.

- The logview post-processing tool now accepts alog files instead of
slog files.

Version 3.0.2
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Added BHV_AvoidObstacles to lib_behaviors-marine

- Fixed a bug in IvPBehavior that would miss more than one update
  request happening within the same helm iteration.

- Fixed innocous bug in InfoBuffer that was duplicating new
  entries in the vector records.

- Change in uXMS key mapping - pause is done w/ space bar, not 'p'

Version 3.0.1
---------------------------------------------------------------------
- Fixed a bug in lib_geometry/XYPolygon that failed to reset convexity
  local information after a polygon rotation. The lack of reset could
  cause XYPolygon::contains() function to malfunction in some instances.

- Added the ability to create a Polygon based on ellipse specifications.
  This is a generalization of the XYPolygon class in lib_geometry.

- The pMarineViewer is able to render ellipses (typically used for 
  uncertaintly ellipses). The details are in Section X.Y of the 
  "Guide to the IvPHelm document".

- Added a --force feature to app_splug to allow an automatic overwrite
  of an existing file without prompting for confirmation from the user.

- Fixed a bug in ZAIC_PEAK that emerges when the minutil is set with a
  value greater than zero.

- The IvPHelm works properly with pLogger to ensure that Behavior Files
  (.bhv files) are being logged alongside the .moos files

- Fixed a bug in the helm that was misssing behavior variable-register 
  requests occurring well after the initial startup period.
