uXMS
 Modified to better handle registration for all variables using the new MOOS wildcard 
 capability. Fixed minor bug where uXMS erroneously posted a configuration warning if 
 if the MOOS community was not provided via a mission file.

uPokeDB 
 Minor mod to handle command line args --host= and --port= in a manner more consistent
 with other MOOS-IvP apps.

pHelmIvP
  Behaviors are augmented via an additional overloadable function, onHelmStart(), executed
  by the behavior upon helm startup. This allows behaviors, defined as templates and thus
  not spawned until later, to post info to the MOOSDB that may affect the conditions of 
  their spawning. For example, the collision avoidance behavior posts a request for alerts
  of a certain form, to pBasicContactMgr. 

pBasicContactMgr
  It now accepts alert configurations via the incoming MOOS Variable BCM_ALERT_REQUEST

lib_ivpbuild
  Minor fixes to remove extraneous semicolons in a few files, comply with stricter compiler
  constraints.

uLoadWatch
  A new application to monitor the reported ITER_GAP and ITER_LEN information produced
  by all AppCastingMOOSApp applications.

pNodeReporter
  Augmented to register for LOAD_WARNING messages (from the new uLoadWatch app), and 
  include them in node reports if one is found.
