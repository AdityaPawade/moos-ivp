Version 3.0.2

- Added BHV_AvoidObstacles to lib_behaviors-marine

- Fixed a bug in IvPBehavior that would miss more than one update
  request happening within the same helm iteration.


Version 3.0.1

- Fixed a bug in lib_geometry/XYPolygon that failed to reset convexity
  local information after a polygon rotation. The lack of reset could
  cause XYPolygon::contains() function to malfunction in some instances.

- Added the ability to create a Polygon based on ellipse specifications.
  This is a generalization of the XYPolygon class in lib_geometry.

- The pMarineViewer is able to render ellipses (typically used for 
  uncertaintly ellipses). The details are in Section X.Y of the 
  "Guide to the IvPHelm document".

- Added a --force feature to app_splug to allow an automatic overwrite
  of an existing file without prompting for confirmation from the user.

- Fixed a bug in ZAIC_PEAK that emerges when the minutil is set with a
  value greater than zero.

- The IvPHelm works properly with pLogger to ensure that Behavior Files
  (.bhv files) are being logged alongside the .moos files

- Fixed a bug in the helm that was misssing behavior variable-register 
  requests occurring well after the initial startup period.
