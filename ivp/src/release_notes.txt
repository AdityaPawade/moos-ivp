pHelmIvP
  Behaviors are augmented via an additional overloadable function, onHelmStart(), executed
  by the behavior upon helm startup. This allows behaviors, defined as templates and thus
  not spawned until later, to post info to the MOOSDB that may affect the conditions of 
  their spawning. For example, the collision avoidance behavior posts a request for alerts
  of a certain form, to pBasicContactMgr. 

pBasicContactMgr
  It now accepts alert configurations via the incoming MOOS Variable BCM_ALERT_REQUEST
