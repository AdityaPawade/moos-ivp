# The MOOS subdirectory is the exact directory distributed
# by Oxford, with the following two exceptions. Two local
# edits were made:
#
# (1) A MOOS-VERSION-IS-V-X file is added to MOOS/ to show
#     which Oxford MOOS version is in this MOOS-IvP tree.
# (2) MOOS/NavigationAndControl/CMakeLists.txt is edited to 
#     not build pNav, pHelm, MOOSNavLib, MOOSTaskLib, four
#     fairly large modules generally not needed by users of
#     this repository. There was no CMake BUILD flag for
#     shutting these off, other than shutting off all of
#     NavigationAndControl which contains iRemote.
